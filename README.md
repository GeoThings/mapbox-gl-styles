## Display a map using Mapbox GL JS with a custom style

This project lets you display a full screen map using a custom map style. A tutorial on how this works can be found at http://osm2vectortiles.org. The map style is based on the [OSM Bright style](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-styles) of Mapbox.

Run your favorite webserver and have a look at the map in your browser.

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
